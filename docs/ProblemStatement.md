# Problem Statement
Problem Statement for Assignment 1 for 404notFound from Kristi, Marcel, Franz

## What is the main functionality?
The app uses AI to suggest recipes based on available ingredients. Users can input or upload ingredients, receive tailored recipe ideas, and then customize, save, or add them to a shopping list. The goal is to make cooking simpler, more flexible, and more sustainable.
## Who are the intended users?
People who often cook at home and want quick, personalized recipe suggestions based on what they already have especially those interested in reducing food waste and cooking more efficiently. Also students who want to save time.
## How will you integrate GenAI meaningfully?
GenAI will analyze ingredients (from text or images) and generate suitable, flexible recipes (optionally from a RAG-database). It can also suggest creative alternatives and adapt recipes to dietary needs. We will adjust the prompts to achieve better results.

## Describe some scenarios how your app will function?
#### Phone Scenario
This is applicable when physically standing in front of the fridge with a phone at hand. The user should be able to upload a picture or take one directly from the app. Then, the user gets some AI-generated recipes doable with the provided ingredients. The user can then pick which recipe to cook, save or alter.

#### Desktop Scenario
This is applicable when pondering on some philosophical question with a laptop in front of you. The user should be able to manage all past recipes and get new ones by manually inputting ingredients. The user can also put items in a shopping list. In addition, the user can also check nutritional values of the ingredients.
